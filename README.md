Building Lightbulb App

Iteration 1:
Lightbulb Application allows users to build and train their own models, agents, and multi agent systems, on their own data, and on other external datasets, with no code. Users will be able to select components, add them to a training run, save their model after training, and deploy it/use it. Users will be able to watch their models training, they will be able to interrupt the training runs, save it wherever it is up to, and deploy or add a different dataset to train it on. A simple API is provided to the user for if they want to utilise their model or agent(s) in their other applications.

Iteration 2:
Create components for Mobile and Web App components to allow users to create their own AI Applications using the Lightbulb components.
